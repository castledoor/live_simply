LIVE SIMPLY is a project to explore SVG animations 

<p> Live Simply is made up of excerpts from a book series I find incredibly fascinating. The series contains first hand accounts of people's experiences living simply and the tips and tricks they have learned through doing so. The ones who paved the way for the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_house_movement">tiny house movement.</a> I take no credit for the words that appear on this site, they were curated and published by Bert and Holly Davis</p>

<p>But more importantly I needed a side project to practice animating things, hopefully the quality will improve over time</p>
